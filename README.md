# node-crud-api

This is a study project.
My task is to implement simple CRUD API using in-memory database underneath.
The whole project is in `develop` branch

Note that the file .env.template has been added.
Although this is a training project and no secret information is stored in .env, let's play by the rules right away. In general, just rename .env.template to .env and enter the `port` value (hint - `4000`)
